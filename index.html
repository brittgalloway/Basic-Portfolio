            Hi! I'm Brittney. I am an animator with a strong interest in interactive media and web developement. 
            I went to Califorina College of the Arts in 2010 and graduated in 2014 with my BFA in Animation.
            I've always loved art and design, and while I love the films and products from Walt Disney Studios and Studio Ghibli and many others, I'm not really interested in working at a major animation company. 
            I've found more fulfillment in interactive e-books, animated shorts and web-developement. 
            Potentionally getting into game design and developement as well.
            
            I already have a website for my art and animation at <a href="https://www.sleepygallows.com">Sleepy Gallows</a>. I think it's important to note that the webseries I'm creating with my sister looks a lot like the walk through of a video game. The interset has always been there!
            When I am not animating or fumbling through code, I am drawing or playing Horizon Zero Dawn!
